    "- **Whiskers**: The lines extending from the top and bottom of each box (whiskers) represent the range of the data within 1.5 times the IQR from the Q1 and Q3. Points outside this range are considered outliers.\n",
    "- **Outliers**: Individual points beyond the whiskers are outliers. These are flights with unusually high or low departure delays. Outliers can indicate exceptional circumstances or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the box plots for each carrier, you can compare their performance in terms of departure delays. For example, if a carrier has a high median delay and a large IQR, it suggests that their flights are frequently delayed and the delays are highly variable. Conversely, a carrier with a low median and small IQR is performing better with more consistent departure times. Identifying carriers with consistent delays can guide decisions on improving punctuality and overall service quality."
